Ihor asked us to give him a list of technologies, which we want to use in our project.
Let's write some suggestions with technologies, you think will be suitable for our project, below.

For example:

I'd like to use sass for styling our components.
And I also think it would be good practise to use native js, not JQuery and plugins, but if we will need some plugins
later, it also would not very bad.
